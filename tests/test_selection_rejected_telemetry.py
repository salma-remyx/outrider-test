"""Tests for the selection_rejected telemetry plumbing (REMYX-133).

The selection-pass produces a per-rejected-candidate list with rich
free-form rejection rationale. Before this work the data was only
visible in the local step summary; it didn't reach the engine-side
``recommendation_runs`` telemetry. This made cross-customer analysis
of rejection patterns (baseline code-availability rate, per-(paper,
customer) verdict patterns, deep-research prioritization) impossible
without manual log scraping.

This module ships:

  1. ``_enrich_selection_rejected`` carries ``license_class`` and
     ``license_compat`` alongside the existing arxiv_id / title /
     reason. These are the empirically load-bearing axis identified
     by the REMYX-101 cross-portfolio sprint.
  2. ``_compact_selection_rejected_for_telemetry`` produces a wire
     projection: drops ``title`` (engine resolves from arxiv_id),
     truncates ``reason`` to keep payload bounded, caps the list
     defensively.
  3. ``_post_run_telemetry``'s payload includes the compacted list
     under ``selection_rejected``.

The combination makes "rejection rate by license_class across last
N days" a single SQL query rather than a manual analysis pass.
