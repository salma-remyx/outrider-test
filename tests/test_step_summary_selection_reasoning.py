"""Tests for the v1.4.9 step-summary selection_reasoning section:

  - Renders when selection_reasoning is non-empty
  - Renders OPEN (no collapse) for skipped_by_selection_verification —
    the field is the only meaningful payload for that outcome
  - Renders COLLAPSED for outcomes with a paper / PR / Issue link, so
    the cost line stays above the fold
  - Omits the section when the field is empty / missing
  - Omits the section when the field is the "(selection pass
    unavailable — used highest-relevance candidate as fallback)"
    placeholder — that string is a non-signal, not a real explanation
  - Renders BEFORE the per-paper "Why this paper" section so the
    selection narrative reads first
