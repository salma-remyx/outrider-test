"""Tests for path_matches_glob — specifically that `**` matches zero or
more path segments, so a top-level test file is allowlisted.

Regression: `tests/**/*.py` previously rejected `tests/test_foo.py` (a
file directly under tests/) because fnmatch's `*` crosses `/` but the
literal `/` after `**` still required at least one intermediate segment.
The §3 test gate expects tests at `tests/test_*.py`, so top-level test
files must be allowed.
