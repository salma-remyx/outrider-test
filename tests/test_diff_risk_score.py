"""Tests for the calibrated Diff Risk Score gate (RADAR).

Exercises both the new `diff_risk_score` module and its wiring into the
existing `run` module:

  * the score is computed from the SAME static-diff helpers the funnel's
    other gates use (`run.changed_files`, `run._diff_line_changes`,
    `run._added_callables`), so we build real working-tree diffs and assert
    the band a `process_target` run would route on;
  * `run` re-exports the scorer and the auto-land threshold it gates on,
    proving the call site imports the new capability.

Run with: pytest tests/ -q
