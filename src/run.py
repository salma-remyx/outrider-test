run.py — Entry point for the remyxai/outrider composite GitHub Action.

The action runs once per workflow invocation; it opens a draft PR (or
an Issue when the recommended paper can't be cleanly scaffolded)
against the repo the action runs in.

Flow:

  1. Recommendation: GET /api/v1.0/papers/recommended on engine.remyx.ai
     for the configured ResearchInterest. Remyx server-side handles
     commit-history extraction, candidate pool, embedding pre-filter,
     and LLM ranking — this action is a pure consumer.
  2. Confidence gate: skip Low / Noise tiers.
  3. Dedup: skip if an open PR already exists for this paper's arxiv_id
     (branch == `remyx-recommendation/{arxiv_id}`), or if any
     remyx-recommendation PR was opened within `rate-limit-days`.
  4. Clone the target repo (= GITHUB_REPOSITORY), branch from main.
  5. Write the spec bundle to `.remyx-recommendation/`:
       SPEC.md, PAPER.md, CONTEXT.md, GUARDRAILS.md, INVOCATION.md
  6. Invoke Claude Code (headless) with INVOCATION.md as the brief.
  7. Issue-fallback: if Claude wrote `.remyx-recommendation/OPEN_AS_ISSUE.md`
     (paper can't be scaffolded against this codebase) open an Issue
     with its reasoning and exit.
  8. Path-allowlist enforcement: reject if Claude touched files outside
     the allowed set.
  9. pytest in the workdir.
 10. Commit (with the bundle dir scrubbed), push, open the PR.

Inputs are read from env vars set by the action's `with:` block
(action.yml maps `inputs.X` → `INPUT_X`). Secrets and the workflow's
GITHUB_TOKEN are passed through unchanged.

  TARGET_REPO            — github.repository (the repo to operate on)
  INPUT_INTEREST_ID      — required, the Remyx ResearchInterest UUID
  INPUT_MIN_CONFIDENCE   — "high" | "moderate" | "low" (default: moderate)
  INPUT_DRAFT_MODE       — "always" | "on_test_failure" | "never" (default: always)
  INPUT_RATE_LIMIT_DAYS  — int, default 7
  REMYX_API_KEY          — engine.remyx.ai token (set as a workflow secret)
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY      — Claude Code auth (set as a workflow secret)
  GITHUB_TOKEN           — workflow's built-in token, or a cross-repo PAT

The orchestrator already read the target repo's convention-defining files
for you. Use the patterns below to shape your generated code, PR title,

(that's redundant cost) — the relevant content is summarized here.

{contributor_guides_block}
{pr_template_block}
{recent_merged_prs_block}
{tooling_config_block}
{verification_stack_block}
{nearby_files_block}
{nearby_tests_block}

## How to use this orientation

- **PR title**: match the convention shown in the recent merged PRs above
  (the title pattern — e.g. `<scope>: <verb> <thing>` if that's what
  recent merges follow). Do not use Remyx-prefixed titles.
- **PR body**: if the PR template is shown above, conform to its section
  structure. Otherwise produce a clean summary + test plan.
- **Code style**: match what the existing nearby files do — import style
  (relative vs absolute), naming, formatting. The lint config (if shown)
  is the source of truth for what passes.
- **Type checking**: if the repo uses mypy or pyright, the orientation
  block lists the configured strictness. Match the patterns the existing
  tests use for any TypedDict / async / union narrowing.
- **Test design**: match the existing test patterns — go through public
  interfaces, not internal attributes; use the same fixtures and helpers
  the existing tests use.

If the orientation block is empty or missing a section, that signal is
informative: either the repo has no contributor guide / PR template /
lint config (treat as no strict convention to follow) or the orchestrator
couldn't read it (rare; surface in your summary if so).

                                              and a few sample existing files
                                              + tests near the planned call
                                              site. Use these patterns
                                              without re-exploring them.

SPEC.md names a PROPOSED CALL SITE under "How this maps onto your repo"
(the file + function the selection pass judged most implementable). Start
there, and keep exploration minimal — broad repo-wandering is the main
cost to avoid:
  - Open ONLY that file plus the modules its target function directly
    imports or calls. Read narrow line ranges, not whole files.
  - Use grep / symbol search to confirm the call site and local
    conventions. Do NOT list or read the whole `{package}/` or `tests/`
    tree.
  - Skip generated, vendored, lockfile, data, and notebook files, and any
    file over ~1500 lines unless the call site is inside it.
  - Once you can name the exact function you will call, STOP exploring and
    implement. Confirming the call site should take only a few reads.
Depth at the chosen call site is fine; breadth across the repo is not.

# Step 1 — decide: PR or Issue

DEFAULT: open an Issue. PR is the exception, not the rule.

Open as PR only if BOTH of these hold:

  (a) You can identify a SPECIFIC existing module/function in `{package}/`
      where this paper's contribution slots in (the "call site").

  (b) You can deliver the paper's CORE INSIGHT or RESULT as a useful,
      scoped change at that call site. You do NOT need to reproduce the
      paper's full method, architecture, training procedure, or reported
      numbers. A small change that moves the repo in the paper's
      direction (a scorer, filter, metric, evaluation hook, or focused
      behavior change) is the INTENDED deliverable, not a fallback.

Open as Issue if any of these is true:

  - The paper's contribution requires infrastructure the codebase lacks
    (a trainer when the repo is inference-only, a dataset format the
    repo never touches, external checkpoints with no path to load).
  - You cannot point at a specific existing call site to modify.
  - Your implementation would be a freestanding module that no existing
    code imports or calls — i.e. it could be deleted without breaking
    or altering anything in the repo.
  - You'd be inventing the integration rather than slotting into one.

If ANY of those hold, DO NOT WRITE CODE. Write a file at
`{issue_fallback_filename}` with this exact shape (Markdown):

```
# Title: short, action-oriented (becomes the Issue title)
Optional one-line subtitle.

## Why this paper is interesting for the team

(2-3 sentences from the spec + your own reading)

## What blocks a clean implementation

(Specifics: missing infra, no clear call site, required external
artifacts. Be concrete about what would need to exist for a real
integration to be drafted.)

## What we'd need to know / decide first

(1-3 questions or decisions the team should resolve before this becomes
implementable.)
```

The orchestrator detects this file and opens an Issue instead of a PR.
This is the HONEST outcome when a PR would be premature, not a failure.

# Step 2 — only if you're proceeding with PR: implement an INTEGRATION

The goal is the smallest change that calls into existing code and
delivers the paper's core insight as value to THIS repo. Implement the
RESULT, not the technique — do not port a trainer, model, or loss the repo
cannot host. NOT a scaffold. NOT a freestanding module.

Required outputs:

1. **At least one EDIT to an existing file** in `{package}/` that
   actually invokes your new code (the call site). A 3-line hook in
   `evaluation.py` that calls a new scorer is the model. Without this
   edit, the orchestrator will reject the run as scaffold-shaped.

   Keep each existing-file edit small — under ~50 lines net change.
   Larger edits get rejected.

2. **A capability-named module**, NOT `<paper-slug>_integration.py`.
   Pick a name that fits the repo's existing conventions and describes
   what the module DOES, not which paper it came from. Examples:
   `cot_grounding_check.py`, `pointcloud_quality.py`, `mask_refiner.py`.
   Paper attribution goes in the module docstring and README — never
   the filename. Keep the new file focused; if you need more than ~250
   lines, you're probably scaffolding.

3. **At least one new test that imports from a NON-NEW module** in
   `{package}/`. Pure self-tests of the new file don't prove
   integration. Example: a test that imports the existing call-site
   module, exercises the wiring edit you made, and asserts the
   integrated behavior.

4. **README documentation** (only if the repo's convention does this).
   ORIENTATION.md shows the repo's existing README style — if the
   convention is to mention new examples/modules in the README, add a
   short "(Capability) — adapted from (Paper Title)" section in the same
   shape as the existing entries. If the repo's README doesn't carry
   per-feature documentation, DON'T add a section. Do NOT add marketing
   attribution links to the codebase — attribution lives in the PR body
   footer (handled by the orchestrator), not in the maintainer's repo.

# Honesty rules

- If the public surface of your new module is dominated by `TODO`,
  `pass`, or `raise NotImplementedError` (more than ~half the
  function bodies), you are scaffolding. STOP and write the Issue file
  instead — the orchestrator will reject the run anyway.
- If your new module would import cleanly but never be called by
  anything else in the repo, STOP and write the Issue file instead.
- The Issue-mode path is the correct route when a PR would be premature.
  It is NOT a failure mode.

Run pytest before declaring done. If tests fail, fix them or scope down
to a smaller integration; do not modify files outside the guardrails
allowlist.

# CRITICAL: do not run git commands

You MUST NOT run any `git` command during your session (`git init`,
`git checkout`, `git stash`, `git reset`, `git commit`, `git add`,
`git rm`, `git rebase`, etc. — none of them, including `git status`).
The orchestrator manages all version control. Past runs have hit
subtle issues where agents ran a `git checkout` to back out a
half-edit and left the working tree in an orphan state that broke
the PR.

If you need to back out an edit, use the file-edit tools to restore
the file's content. Look up the original content via standard read
tools — do not invoke git.

When complete, output a one-paragraph SUMMARY of what you built. Call out:
  - Which existing file you modified (the call site)
  - Which new module you created (the capability name)
  - The paper insight this delivers, and what you intentionally scoped
    out as unnecessary for that value — frame these as scoping decisions,
    not shortfalls. A focused slice that delivers the result is success.

Still distinguish "intentionally out of scope" (expected) from
"stubbed / incomplete" (TODO-dominated bodies) — the latter still routes
to an Issue per the honesty rules above.

Inputs follow at the end of this message:
  1. The paper spec (title, abstract, why-this-paper, suggested experiment)
  2. A candidate-selection rationale (in the spec, under "How this maps

Evaluate the SCOPED implementation the selection rationale describes — the
implementable subset wired into the named call sites — NOT the paper's
full or maximal contribution. A paper whose maximal form needs missing
infra (a trainer, a renderer, a synthesis engine) can still be a sound PR
if the selection rationale identifies a real, smaller slice that drops
into an existing call site (e.g. consuming a paper's released benchmark
through the existing eval path, rather than rebuilding its data-generation
engine). Don't route to ISSUE merely because the paper's headline method
is heavy — judge the scoped slice.

Route to ISSUE only if any of these is likely true of THAT scoped slice:

  - Even the scoped implementation requires infrastructure that isn't in
    the repo (a trainer when the repo is inference-only, a data format the
    repo never touches, checkpoints with no loader path).
  - There is no clear call site — no existing module that naturally hosts
    even the scoped contribution (and the selection rationale, if present,
    names none that hold up against the layout).
  - The most realistic implementation would be a freestanding module that
    no existing code would call.

__LAYOUT__
"""

_SELECTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are selecting which paper recommendation the Remyx Recommendation
orchestrator should implement as a draft PR against the target repo
(`__REPO_FULLNAME__`).

You are given a ranked candidate pool (top-N from the Remyx ranker)
and the target repo's module layout. Relevance rank is NOT
implementability: the top-ranked paper is frequently a model
architecture or training method with no call site in a data / inference
pipeline, while a lower-ranked candidate is a clean drop-in. Surface
overlap with a repo's keywords does NOT mean methodological fit — two
papers using "Stein's method" can belong to entirely different problem
classes (e.g. supervised encoding vs. posterior inference).

**Your job is to VERIFY before picking.** Use the tools below
iteratively. For your most promising candidate(s):
  - Find the call site you'd integrate into (`gh code-search` over the
    repo to locate the relevant module / function).
  - Read 1-2 lines of the actual code to confirm the integration shape
    is what the paper assumes (`gh api repos/<repo>/contents/<path>`
    or `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<repo>/main/<path>`).
  - Check whether the team is actively working on a thread the paper
    extends (`gh issue list --repo <repo> --state open --search "..."`
    or `gh issue view <n> --repo <repo>` for specific Issues).

**Four legitimate integration shapes — classify each candidate you
consider.** A candidate that does NOT fit one of these four shapes is
a structural mismatch and should be rejected.

  - **addition** — paper adds a NEW module that is called from EXISTING
    code. The repo's current modules stay; new code is wired in. Most
    common shape. Verification: existing call site exists, the new
    module's I/O contract fits the forward path.

  - **replacement** — paper's contribution is a strict drop-in
    REPLACEMENT for an existing component with the same input/output
    contract but better internals (smaller / faster / simpler / newer
    foundation). The existing component is removed; the new one slots
    into its place. Verification: identify the existing component's
    I/O contract; confirm the paper's contract is functionally
    equivalent; estimate migration cost (which files change).

  - **simplification** — paper merges TWO OR MORE existing components
    into one with the same end-to-end contract. Pipeline collapses.
    Verification: identify the existing pipeline's boundary contract;
    confirm the merged contribution spans those boundaries cleanly;
    estimate migration cost.

  - **extension** — paper proposes a NEW capability the repo currently
    lacks but that fits as a natural extension of the existing pipeline
    shape AND the team has signaled openness to it. STRICTER bar than
    addition (no existing call site to anchor against). ALL FOUR gates
    must pass for a candidate to be classified as extension:
      1. **Pipeline-compatible I/O contract** — the new capability fits
         the repo's existing pipeline shape (e.g. for a data-pipeline
         repo, "dataset in, dataset out" is extension-compatible; a
         stage that requires a fundamentally new data shape is not).
      2. **Stated team-direction signal in the repo** — at least one
         explicit signal that the team is open to this capability:
         a README "future directions" / "roadmap" section naming the
         domain; an open Issue with title `[RFC]` / `[Proposal]` or
         labeled `rfc` / `discussion` whose body names this paper or
         a similar technique; a CONTEXT.md bullet showing recent
         investment in adjacent capabilities; the interest description
         itself naming the broader domain. Without ≥1 explicit signal,
         this is RFC-fishing, not extension — REJECT.
      3. **No existing implementation in the repo** — `gh code-search`
         confirms no existing module implements the candidate's
         contribution. If a partial implementation exists, this is
         addition or replacement, not extension.
      4. **Higher relevance + interest-alignment bar than addition** —
         tier MUST be `high` AND relevance MUST be ≥ 0.85 AND the
         `reasoning` field MUST verbalize the interest-alignment.
         Gates 1-3 carry the structural-fit load — gate 4 is a
         "ranker put this candidate in the top band" sanity check,
         not a second pass on relevance.
    Verification: cite the specific team-direction signal that satisfies
    gate 2 in the `team_direction_signal` schema field below. Cite the
    adjacent pipeline stage (upstream or downstream of the proposed new
    stage) in `proposed_call_site`.

Replacement and simplification need a STRICTER bar than addition: the
I/O contracts must align functionally, not just thematically. A paper
that "could replace" an existing component but whose actual inputs or
outputs differ from what downstream code expects is a structural
mismatch, not a replacement. Surface keyword overlap (same domain, same
technique name) does NOT make a replacement — only contract-equivalent
substitution does. Stein-Encoder is NOT a replacement for SteinVI even
though both invoke "Stein's method" — the I/O contracts are different
problem classes.

**Tie-break — when implementability is comparable, prefer
simplification > replacement > addition > extension.** A paper that
lets the maintainer simplify, accelerate, or replace an existing stage
tends to produce deeper engagement than a paper that adds a parallel
feature, all else equal. Extension is LAST-RESORT — picked only when
all three other shapes fail AND all four extension gates pass.
Reasons:

  - The repo's existing contracts are already in production. A
    proposal anchored on one of those contracts carries leverage that
    a net-new module doesn't — the maintainer doesn't have to decide
    "is this worth integrating at all" because the contract is
    already worth integrating.
  - Simplification proposals tend to ship as deliberation Issues
    (phased rollout, fallback paths, when-to-revisit thresholds)
    that preserve value even when not adopted as PRs.
  - Net-new add-alongside picks correlate with PRs that go stale or
    get rejected because the repo's actual call sites don't need them.
  - Extension picks have NO call site at all — they propose adding
    one. Without explicit team-direction signal, an extension pick is
    indistinguishable from RFC-fishing. The four gates exist to filter
    legitimate extensions (where the team has invited the capability)
    from speculation.

When two candidates score similarly on the verification bar, favor
the one that touches more existing call sites — even if its surface
relevance is lower. An add-alongside pick is still legitimate when
the broad pool genuinely lacks contract-anchored candidates; just
don't prefer it by default.

If after verification the pre-fetched candidates all turn out to be
poor structural fits, broaden the search:
  - `remyxai search info <arxiv_id>` — direct arxiv-id lookup; use this
    FIRST when a maintainer thread or repo context names a specific
    paper with an arxiv id (`arxiv NNNN.NNNNN`). The keyword search
    endpoint occasionally misses indexed assets whose names don't
    tokenize cleanly (CamelCase compound names, multi-word coinages),
    so direct lookup is the authoritative path when an id is known.
  - `remyxai search query "<technique_or_paper_name>"` — keyword search
    of the broader Remyx catalog. Use when no arxiv id is named and
    you're searching the technique space.
  - `remyxai papers list --interest <uuid> --limit 20 --format json`
    — pull a larger slice of the ranker's pool

When the broader catalog surfaces a candidate that satisfies one of the
three integration shapes — especially when a maintainer thread (an open
Issue, an active PR discussion) names a specific paper that the pool
doesn't contain AND the paper is not already in the "Already in the
team's attention" section above — you MAY return it as an
**out-of-pool pick** using the extended schema below (`chosen_index:
-2`). Papers in the discharge set have already been put in front of
the maintainer (either by Outrider or by a maintainer-opened RFC) and
must not be re-picked here, in-pool or out — selecting one wastes the
selection-pass budget and the dedup gate would skip it anyway.

The verification bar for out-of-pool picks is STRICTER than for
in-pool: the search result must explicitly match the contract the
maintainer thread (or the search query's intent) asks for — not merely
thematically related. If the search returns nothing that satisfies the
bar, fall back to `chosen_index: -1`.

Default to picking from the candidates below when one fits cleanly.
Returning `chosen_index: -1` is allowed when every in-pool candidate
fails verification AND no out-of-pool candidate cleanly satisfies the
verification bar — explain why in `reasoning`.

Tools available:
  - `gh code-search "<query>" --repo <repo>` — find call sites
  - `gh api repos/<repo>/contents/<path>` — read a file by path
  - `gh issue list/view` — see open maintainer concerns
  - `remyxai papers list/get` — inspect the ranker pool with reasoning
  - `remyxai interests get` — see the interest's project-summary context
  - `remyxai search info <arxiv_id>` — direct lookup of a known asset,
    bypasses keyword-search retrieval gaps
  - `remyxai search query` — keyword broaden beyond the pool if needed

Recovery strategies for missing/broken links (apply BEFORE concluding
"paper has no code" or "candidate is unreadable"):
  - **Arxiv URL variants.** If `arxiv.org/html/<id>` 404s or returns a
    near-empty page, try `arxiv.org/abs/<id>` first (most reliable),
    then `ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/<id>` (HTML5 mirror — better for very
    recent papers), then `arxiv.org/pdf/<id>` as last resort.
  - **Dead live URLs (project pages, github repos).** Academic project
    pages routinely die within months. If `WebFetch <url>` 404s or
    times out, try `web.archive.org/web/<url>` for the latest archived
    snapshot. Especially relevant for `*.github.io/*` project pages
    and university-hosted demo sites.
  - **Engine reports `github_url: (none)` but code likely exists.**
    Don't take the engine's null at face value. In order:
      1. `gh search code "<distinctive method name from paper>"` — the
         method name (not the paper title) usually surfaces the official
         repo if one exists.
      2. WebFetch the arxiv abstract page and grep for `github.com/`
         links — abstracts often mention code that the engine's
         regex missed.
      3. If `huggingface_url` is populated, WebFetch the model card —
         it routinely cross-references the official codebase.
      4. If a project page is mentioned in the abstract, follow it
         one hop — code links cluster on project pages even when
         absent from the abstract.
    Treat "no code found" as a verdict you reach AFTER exhausting these,
    not a default. Many engine `github_url: (none)` cases have code
    reachable via one of these paths (REMYX-100 will fix this at ingest;
    until then, agent-side recovery is the defense).
  - **Login-wall detection.** Pages from Colab, Drive, JSTOR, OpenReview
    can return HTTP 200 with sign-in content that LOOKS like real
    content. If a fetched page is < 500 chars of non-nav body AND
    contains "Sign in" / "Log in" / "Please log in", treat as
    unfetched (the content you got is not the content you wanted).
    Note in `reasoning` if a login-wall blocked verification.
  - **Failure budget.** Spend at most ~3 turns on recovery per
    candidate before moving on. If a candidate has multiple broken
    links and no reachable code/context, that itself is a signal —
    document the failed lookups in `reasoning` and reject the
    candidate rather than burning the turn budget guessing.

Stop iterating once you have enough evidence to pick (verified one
candidate fits one of the three shapes) OR to reject all (every
candidate has a structural mismatch). Don't burn turns on diminishing
returns.

                   quality: rich, correct code that the product never calls

Be ruthless about reachability. If the only thing that calls your new code

a CLI, an existing module) now invokes your new code, set is_orphan=false.
Separately, list under scoped_out the parts of the paper you deliberately
left for later (e.g. a trainer/model the repo can't host) — you are not
required to reproduce the paper's full method, only to deliver its result.

_AUDIT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are auditing a candidate pool of arXiv papers for relevance gaps
against a target code repository, and proposing 1-3 *refine queries*
that would surface adjacent-but-missing themes from the Remyx search
backend.

The goal: catch high-value papers that the engine's normal ranking
misses because they fall outside the repo's import graph. Typical gaps:
the broad pool over-represents one or two stages of the pipeline while
adjacent themes the maintainer cares about (substitutes for an imported
model, training-recipe upgrades, alternative implementations of a
stage) are absent despite being core to the repo's thesis.

Target repo
-----------
__REPO_FULLNAME__

Research interest the team registered
-------------------------------------
__INTEREST_NAME__

__INTEREST_CONTEXT__

Repo README excerpt (top __README_CHARS__ chars)
------------------------------------------------
__README__

Themes Outrider has already surfaced recently (last __RECENT_N__ Issues)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
__RECENT_ISSUES__

Broad candidate pool currently being considered (__BROAD_N__ papers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
__BROAD_BRIEF__

Your task
---------
1. Cluster the broad pool by theme. Identify themes that are
   *over-represented* (3+ papers covering the same angle) OR that match
   the repo's recent-Issues history (already-covered territory).
2. Identify themes the repo's README + interest context implies the
   maintainer cares about, but that are absent or under-represented in
   the broad pool.
3. **Bias your refine queries toward SIMPLIFY / REPLACE / ACCELERATE
   angles over ADD-ALONGSIDE angles.** Look specifically for:
     - Two-model or multi-step pipeline stages that could become one
     - Imported foundation models that have published successors
     - Multi-step processes the repo runs that could become single-pass
     - Libraries the repo depends on that could be retired
     - Stages where the imported model's claim (speedup, accuracy)
       could be empirically validated against the repo's typical scale
   Ask "what could SIMPLIFY or REPLACE stage X in this repo?" before
   asking "what's ADJACENT to X?". An add-alongside query is acceptable
   only when the README or interest context explicitly names a missing
   capability — otherwise the repo's existing contracts already
   represent the highest-leverage surfaces to improve.
4. For each under-represented theme that's a genuine fit, draft a single
   keyword-style search query — 4-8 terms, no quotes, no boolean
   operators. The Remyx /search/assets backend is keyword-matched, so
   the strongest signal words should appear first.
5. Output 1-3 queries (no more than 3). Quality beats quantity — if the
   broad pool already covers everything the maintainer would care about,
   return zero queries with a one-line reasoning. If you propose a
   query, the reasoning must explain *what theme* it targets, *why* the
   broad pool missed it, and which existing repo contract it anchors on
   (or call out explicitly that it's an add-alongside justified by an
   explicit README/interest signal).

Output strictly this JSON object (no prose wrapper):
{
  "refine_queries": ["query 1", "query 2", ...],
  "reasoning": "one paragraph explaining the audit and the queries"

_WEEKLY_NARRATIVE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """\
You are drafting the interpretive sections of Outrider's weekly digest
for the repository __REPO__. Below: the week's aggregated run data
(including the distinct candidate papers the selection pass saw), the
open Outrider artifacts awaiting maintainer review, and — when present —
last week's digest. Your output supplements the data sections; do NOT
restate them.

Aggregated run data (JSON)
--------------------------
__AGG_JSON__

Open Outrider artifacts awaiting review (number, title, body excerpt)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
__OPEN_ITEMS__

Last week's digest (excerpt; may be empty)
------------------------------------------
__PRIOR_DIGEST__

Produce strictly this JSON object (no prose wrapper):
{
  "verdict_bullets": ["...", ...],
  "refine_themes": [{"theme": "...", "queries": N, "hit_rate": "..."}, ...],
  "patterns": ["...", ...],
  "research_trends": ["...", ...],
  "next_actions": {"<artifact number>": "<short next action>", ...}
}

Style — every string is a terse fragment, NOT a full sentence. No
trailing periods. The reader is skimming; distill each point to its
essence.

Rules:
- verdict_bullets: 2-3 fragments on what the selection pass did this
  week — what it anchored on, what it rejected and why. Verbatim
  reasoning quotes are rendered separately; never paraphrase them.
  Quotes exist only for verification-skip runs, so their absence in a
  week with PR/Issue outcomes is normal — NOT a wiring failure.
- refine_themes: cluster the refine queries into themes; per-theme query
  count + one-phrase hit-rate assessment. Empty list when no queries.
- patterns: 3-5 entries about operating Outrider better. Format:
  "**Noun phrase** — evidence → concrete maintainer action". Evidence
  MUST cite numbers from the data.
- research_trends: 2-4 entries on the research themes moving through
  this repo's recommendation stream (NOT arxiv at large — the pool is
  shaped by this repo's interest). Format: "**Theme** — N of M
  candidates, what it means for this repo". Only claim a trend with
  >= 2 supporting candidates; always cite the counts. Use last week's
  digest for week-over-week deltas only when it actually supports the
  claim. Do NOT duplicate content between patterns and research_trends:
  patterns = operate the tool, research_trends = the field.
- next_actions: for each open artifact whose body makes the next step
  obvious (a flag to flip, a license to re-check, a question to answer),
  a short action fragment. Omit artifacts with no clear next action.
