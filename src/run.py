run.py — Entry point for the remyxai/remyx-recommendation-action
composite GitHub Action.

The action runs once per workflow invocation; it opens a draft PR (or
an Issue when the recommended paper can't be cleanly scaffolded)
against the repo the action runs in.

Flow:

  1. Recommendation: GET /api/v1.0/papers/recommended on engine.remyx.ai
     for the configured ResearchInterest. Remyx server-side handles
     commit-history extraction, candidate pool, embedding pre-filter,
     and Gemini ranking — this action is a pure consumer.
  2. Confidence gate: skip Low / Noise tiers.
  3. Dedup: skip if an open PR already exists for this paper's arxiv_id
     (branch == `remyx-recommendation/{arxiv_id}`), or if any
     remyx-recommendation PR was opened within `rate-limit-days`.
  4. Clone the target repo (= GITHUB_REPOSITORY), branch from main.
  5. Write the spec bundle to `.remyx-recommendation/`:
       SPEC.md, PAPER.md, CONTEXT.md, GUARDRAILS.md, INVOCATION.md
  6. Invoke Claude Code (headless) with INVOCATION.md as the brief.
  7. Issue-fallback: if Claude wrote `.remyx-recommendation/OPEN_AS_ISSUE.md`
     (paper can't be scaffolded against this codebase) open an Issue
     with its reasoning and exit.
  8. Path-allowlist enforcement: reject if Claude touched files outside
     the allowed set.
  9. pytest in the workdir.
 10. Commit (with the bundle dir scrubbed), push, open the PR.

Inputs are read from env vars set by the action's `with:` block
(action.yml maps `inputs.X` → `INPUT_X`). Secrets and the workflow's
GITHUB_TOKEN are passed through unchanged.

  TARGET_REPO            — github.repository (the repo to operate on)
  INPUT_INTEREST_ID      — required, the Remyx ResearchInterest UUID
  INPUT_MIN_CONFIDENCE   — "high" | "moderate" | "low" (default: moderate)
  INPUT_DRAFT_MODE       — "always" | "on_test_failure" | "never" (default: always)
  INPUT_RATE_LIMIT_DAYS  — int, default 7
  REMYX_API_KEY          — engine.remyx.ai token (set as a workflow secret)
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY      — Claude Code auth (set as a workflow secret)
  GITHUB_TOKEN           — workflow's built-in token, or a cross-repo PAT

_INVOCATION_MD_TEMPLATE = """\
You are a coding agent implementing a recommendation from the Remyx
Recommendation pipeline (attribution URL: {attribution_url}).

Read these files in order:
  1. .remyx-recommendation/SPEC.md       — the implementation spec (paper,
                                            why-this-paper, suggested
                                            experiment, team's research-
                                            focus body, abstract)
  2. .remyx-recommendation/PAPER.md      — paper title + abstract
  3. .remyx-recommendation/CONTEXT.md    — team context (recent merges,
                                            if Remyx returned any)
  4. .remyx-recommendation/GUARDRAILS.md — what you may and may not modify

Then look at the existing codebase structure (especially the `{package}/`
package and `tests/` directory) to understand the project's conventions,
the existing call sites, and what actually exists to integrate against.

# Step 1 — decide: PR or Issue

DEFAULT: open an Issue. PR is the exception, not the rule.

Open as PR only if BOTH of these hold:

  (a) You can identify a SPECIFIC existing module/function in `{package}/`
      where this paper's contribution slots in (the "call site").

  (b) The paper's PRIMARY contribution can be implemented end-to-end
      here, OR the integration produces a USEFUL SIGNAL on real
      pipeline output without the paper's neural/checkpoint components
      (e.g. a quality filter, a scorer, an evaluation hook).

Open as Issue if any of these is true:

  - The paper's contribution requires infrastructure the codebase lacks
    (a trainer when the repo is inference-only, a dataset format the
    repo never touches, external checkpoints with no path to load).
  - You cannot point at a specific existing call site to modify.
  - Your implementation would be a freestanding module that no existing
    code imports or calls — i.e. it could be deleted without breaking
    or altering anything in the repo.
  - You'd be inventing the integration rather than slotting into one.

If ANY of those hold, DO NOT WRITE CODE. Write a file at
`{issue_fallback_filename}` with this exact shape (Markdown):

```
# Title: short, action-oriented (becomes the Issue title)
Optional one-line subtitle.

## Why this paper is interesting for the team

(2-3 sentences from the spec + your own reading)

## What blocks a clean implementation

(Specifics: missing infra, no clear call site, required external
artifacts. Be concrete about what would need to exist for a real
integration to be drafted.)

## What we'd need to know / decide first

(1-3 questions or decisions the team should resolve before this becomes
implementable.)
```

The orchestrator detects this file and opens an Issue instead of a PR.
This is the HONEST outcome when the paper doesn't fit, not a failure.

# Step 2 — only if you're proceeding with PR: implement an INTEGRATION

The goal is the smallest change that calls into existing code with
paper-derived behavior. NOT a scaffold. NOT a freestanding module.

Required outputs:

1. **At least one EDIT to an existing file** in `{package}/` that
   actually invokes your new code (the call site). A 3-line hook in
   `evaluation.py` that calls a new scorer is the model. Without this
   edit, the orchestrator will reject the run as scaffold-shaped.

   Keep each existing-file edit small — under ~50 lines net change.
   Larger edits get rejected.

2. **A capability-named module**, NOT `<paper-slug>_integration.py`.
   Pick a name that fits the repo's existing conventions and describes
   what the module DOES, not which paper it came from. Examples:
   `cot_grounding_check.py`, `pointcloud_quality.py`, `mask_refiner.py`.
   Paper attribution goes in the module docstring and README — never
   the filename. Keep the new file focused; if you need more than ~250
   lines, you're probably scaffolding.

3. **At least one new test that imports from a NON-NEW module** in
   `{package}/`. Pure self-tests of the new file don't prove
   integration. Example: a test that imports the existing call-site
   module, exercises the wiring edit you made, and asserts the
   integrated behavior.

4. **README append**: a short "(Capability) — adapted from (Paper Title)"
   section at the end. Attribute with this exact line (one Markdown
   link to the customer-facing Remyx product page):

       Contributed via [Remyx Recommendation]({attribution_url}).

   Do NOT use a different URL. The orchestrator's source repo is
   private; this link is the only one that resolves for external readers.

# Honesty rules

- If the public surface of your new module is dominated by `TODO`,
  `pass`, or `raise NotImplementedError` (more than ~half the
  function bodies), you are scaffolding. STOP and write the Issue file
  instead — the orchestrator will reject the run anyway.
- If your new module would import cleanly but never be called by
  anything else in the repo, STOP and write the Issue file instead.
- The Issue-mode path is the correct route when the paper doesn't fit.
  It is NOT a failure mode.

Run pytest before declaring done. If tests fail, fix them or scope down
to a smaller integration; do not modify files outside the guardrails
allowlist.

# CRITICAL: do not run git commands

You MUST NOT run any `git` command during your session (`git init`,
`git checkout`, `git stash`, `git reset`, `git commit`, `git add`,
`git rm`, `git rebase`, etc. — none of them, including `git status`).
The orchestrator manages all version control. Past runs have hit
subtle issues where agents ran a `git checkout` to back out a
half-edit and left the working tree in an orphan state that broke
the PR.

If you need to back out an edit, use the file-edit tools to restore
the file's content. Look up the original content via standard read
tools — do not invoke git.

When complete, output a one-paragraph SUMMARY of what you actually
built. Call out:
  - Which existing file you modified (the call site)
  - Which new module you created (the capability name)
  - What in the paper's method you implemented vs. left out

Be honest about what you stubbed vs implemented.

You are routing a paper recommendation for the Remyx Recommendation
orchestrator. Decide: should the implementation step run (PR), or
should we open an Issue for the team to discuss first?

Inputs follow at the end of this message:
  1. The paper spec (title, abstract, why-this-paper, suggested experiment)
  2. A candidate-selection rationale (in the spec, under "How this maps
     onto your repo") — when present, a prior pass already judged this
     paper implementable against THIS repo and named the call sites and
     the implementable SUBSET it targets.
  3. The target repo's module layout

Evaluate the SCOPED implementation the selection rationale describes — the
implementable subset wired into the named call sites — NOT the paper's
full or maximal contribution. A paper whose maximal form needs missing
infra (a trainer, a renderer, a synthesis engine) can still be a sound PR
if the selection rationale identifies a real, smaller slice that drops
into an existing call site (e.g. consuming a paper's released benchmark
through the existing eval path, rather than rebuilding its data-generation
engine). Don't route to ISSUE merely because the paper's headline method
is heavy — judge the scoped slice.

Route to ISSUE only if any of these is likely true of THAT scoped slice:

  - Even the scoped implementation requires infrastructure that isn't in
    the repo (a trainer when the repo is inference-only, a data format the
    repo never touches, checkpoints with no loader path).
  - There is no clear call site — no existing module that naturally hosts
    even the scoped contribution (and the selection rationale, if present,
    names none that hold up against the layout).
  - The most realistic implementation would be a freestanding module that
    no existing code would call.

Otherwise route to PR.

You are selecting which paper recommendation the Remyx Recommendation

You are given a ranked list of candidate papers (ranked by Remyx

rank is NOT implementability: the top-ranked paper is frequently a model
architecture or a training method with no call site in a data / inference
pipeline, while a lower-ranked candidate is a clean drop-in.

Pick the ONE candidate that is most directly implementable as a focused
PR against THIS repo. Prefer a candidate that:
  - maps onto an existing module / call site visible in the layout,
  - is a pipeline / data-generation / eval change the repo can actually

  - ships its contribution as code this repo would call, rather than a
