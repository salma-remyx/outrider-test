run.py — Entry point for the remyxai/remyx-recommendation-action
composite GitHub Action.

The action runs once per workflow invocation; it opens a draft PR (or
an Issue when the recommended paper can't be cleanly scaffolded)
against the repo the action runs in.

Flow:

  1. Recommendation: GET /api/v1.0/papers/recommended on engine.remyx.ai
     for the configured ResearchInterest. Remyx server-side handles
     commit-history extraction, candidate pool, embedding pre-filter,
     and Gemini ranking — this action is a pure consumer.
  2. Confidence gate: skip Low / Noise tiers.
  3. Dedup: skip if an open PR already exists for this paper's arxiv_id
     (branch == `remyx-recommendation/{arxiv_id}`), or if any
     remyx-recommendation PR was opened within `rate-limit-days`.
  4. Clone the target repo (= GITHUB_REPOSITORY), branch from main.
  5. Write the spec bundle to `.remyx-recommendation/`:
       SPEC.md, PAPER.md, CONTEXT.md, GUARDRAILS.md, INVOCATION.md
  6. Invoke Claude Code (headless) with INVOCATION.md as the brief.
  7. Issue-fallback: if Claude wrote `.remyx-recommendation/OPEN_AS_ISSUE.md`
     (paper can't be scaffolded against this codebase) open an Issue
     with its reasoning and exit.
  8. Path-allowlist enforcement: reject if Claude touched files outside
     the allowed set.
  9. pytest in the workdir.
 10. Commit (with the bundle dir scrubbed), push, open the PR.

Inputs are read from env vars set by the action's `with:` block
(action.yml maps `inputs.X` → `INPUT_X`). Secrets and the workflow's
GITHUB_TOKEN are passed through unchanged.

  TARGET_REPO            — github.repository (the repo to operate on)
  INPUT_INTEREST_ID      — required, the Remyx ResearchInterest UUID
  INPUT_MIN_CONFIDENCE   — "high" | "moderate" | "low" (default: moderate)
  INPUT_DRAFT_MODE       — "always" | "on_test_failure" | "never" (default: always)
  INPUT_RATE_LIMIT_DAYS  — int, default 7
  REMYX_API_KEY          — engine.remyx.ai token (set as a workflow secret)
  ANTHROPIC_API_KEY      — Claude Code auth (set as a workflow secret)
  GITHUB_TOKEN           — workflow's built-in token, or a cross-repo PAT

You are a coding agent implementing a recommendation from the Remyx
Recommendation pipeline (attribution URL: {attribution_url}).

Read these files in order:
  1. .remyx-recommendation/SPEC.md       — the implementation spec (paper,
                                            why-this-paper, suggested
                                            experiment, team's research-
                                            focus body, abstract)
  2. .remyx-recommendation/PAPER.md      — paper title + abstract
  3. .remyx-recommendation/CONTEXT.md    — team context (recent merges,
                                            if Remyx returned any)
  4. .remyx-recommendation/GUARDRAILS.md — what you may and may not modify

Then look at the existing codebase structure (especially the `{package}/`
package and `tests/` directory) to understand the project's conventions
and what actually exists to integrate against.

# Step 1 — decide: PR or Issue

After reading the brief AND inspecting the relevant existing code, decide
whether you can produce a *concrete*, *non-vacuous* scaffold. Open as
ISSUE (not PR) if any of these is true:

  - The paper's contribution requires infrastructure the codebase lacks
    (e.g. a trainer when the repo is inference-only, a dataset format
    the repo never touches).
  - The integration point is too vague to pick a real module / API —
    you'd be inventing the integration rather than slotting into one.
  - The paper requires specific external checkpoints, datasets, or
    services the team clearly doesn't have access to, AND the scaffold
    couldn't usefully exist without them.
  - You searched the codebase for the relevant entry points and found
    nothing reasonable to extend or call into.

If ANY of the above hold, DO NOT WRITE CODE. Instead, write a file at
`{issue_fallback_filename}` with this exact shape (Markdown):

```
# Title: short, action-oriented (becomes the Issue title)
Optional one-line subtitle.

## Why this paper is interesting for the team

(2-3 sentences from the spec + your own reading)

## What blocks a clean implementation

(Specifics: missing infra, vague integration point, required external
artifacts, etc. Be concrete about what would need to exist for a real
integration to be drafted.)

## What we'd need to know / decide first

(1-3 questions or decisions the team should resolve before this becomes
implementable.)
```

The orchestrator detects this file and opens a GitHub Issue instead of a
draft PR. No code is committed, no PR is opened, no time is wasted on
scaffolding that would mislead a reviewer.

# Step 2 — only if you DIDN'T write the issue file: implement

Implement the MINIMAL-VIABLE-SCAFFOLDING version of the spec:

- Create one new module under `{package}/` (likely `{package}/<paper_slug>_integration.py`)
  with:
    * A config dataclass (e.g. `<Paper>Config`) holding the paper's reported
      hyperparameters as defaults
    * A class scaffold for the integration entry point. Keep heavy lifting
      (external checkpoint loading, etc.) as documented TODOs so this PR
      doesn't pretend to do work that requires external dependencies.
    * Any utility functions described in the spec (pixel conversions,
      data adapters, etc.) — implement these concretely.

- Create `tests/test_<paper_slug>_integration.py` with passing tests for
  every utility function you implemented concretely. Stub-test the class
  scaffold (smoke test of the no-checkpoint path returning sensible defaults).

- Append a brief "(Paper Title) Integration (experimental) 🧪" section
  to README.md. Attribute the work at the very end of the section
  with this exact line (one Markdown link to the customer-facing
  Remyx product page, no other URL):

      Contributed via [Remyx Recommendation]({attribution_url}).

  Do NOT use a different URL. The orchestrator's source repo is
  private; this link is the only one that resolves for external readers.

Run pytest before declaring done. If tests fail, fix them or scope your
implementation down until they pass. Do not modify files outside the
guardrails allowlist.

# CRITICAL: do not run git commands

You MUST NOT run any `git` command during your session (`git init`,
`git checkout`, `git stash`, `git reset`, `git commit`, `git add`,
`git rm`, `git rebase`, etc. — none of them). The orchestrator manages
all version control. Even commands you think are read-only (e.g.
`git status`) are forbidden — past runs have hit subtle issues where
agents ran a `git checkout` to back out a half-edit and left the
working tree in an orphan state that broke the PR.

If you need to back out an edit, use the file-edit tools to restore
the file's content. If you're unsure what the original content was,
look it up via the standard read tools — do not invoke git.

When complete, output a one-paragraph SUMMARY of what you actually built.
Be honest about what you stubbed vs implemented.
