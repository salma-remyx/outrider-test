"""Calibrated static Diff Risk Score for Outrider's generated PRs.

Adapted from *Automating Low-Risk Code Review at Meta: RADAR, Risk
Calibration, and Review Efficiency* (arXiv:2605.30208). RADAR stratifies
every diff with a machine-learned **Diff Risk Score** computed over static
diff features (change size, files touched, surface added, critical-path
edits), then lets low-risk diffs auto-land while routing higher-risk diffs
to deeper review. A single tunable knob — the score percentile — trades
automation *yield* against *safety*; relaxing it from the 25th to the 50th
percentile raised RADAR's approve rate to ~60% while keeping the revert
rate at 1/3 and the production-incident rate at 1/50 of non-RADAR diffs.

This module ports the *result*, not the trained model: a single calibrated
risk number in [0, 1] plus a low / elevated / high band. The score is a
transparent logistic over exactly the static-diff features Outrider's
funnel already extracts for its other gates (lines changed, files touched,
new public callables, critical-file edits, test-coverage impact) — so it
drops in as one more deterministic gate without needing model internals,
multi-sampling, or any new telemetry infrastructure.

The band drives risk-aware routing at the `process_target` call site:

    score <  ELEVATED         → "low"      — flows straight through the funnel
    ELEVATED ≤ score < ISSUE  → "elevated" — still a PR, but forced to draft
                                             so a human reviews before it lands
    score ≥  ISSUE            → "high"     — routed to a human-review Issue/RFC
                                             instead of an auto-PR

# ── Calibrated thresholds on the 0–1 score ─────────────────────────────────
#
# RADAR exposes one tunable knob — the Diff Risk Score percentile — that
# trades automation yield for safety. These two cut points are that knob
# expressed as fixed score bands. Lowering ISSUE toward ELEVATED widens
# auto-PR yield (more diffs land without a human Issue) at the cost of
# safety; raising it is the conservative direction. Tuned so a typical
# small wiring PR (one new module + a sub-50-line edit + a test) sits well
# inside the low band.
DIFF_RISK_ELEVATED_THRESHOLD = 0.50
DIFF_RISK_ISSUE_THRESHOLD = 0.80

# Critical-path hints: edits to a pre-existing file whose path matches one
# of these carry production risk out of proportion to their size (process
# entry points, package surface, app/CLI/config wiring that lives in-tree).
# Matched on a simple substring basis — kept deliberately small.

# Signs and magnitudes are calibrated (not trained) so that a small,
# tested, non-critical wiring PR lands in "low", a moderate or untested
# change lands in "elevated", and a sprawling multi-file rewrite or an
# untested critical-path edit crosses into "high". The two categorical
# signals (critical-path edit, new surface shipped without any test change)
# are the dominant risk drivers, mirroring RADAR's finding that test
# coverage and blast radius matter more than raw line count.

_W_LINES_OVERFLOW = 0.001  # per line beyond _LINES_CAP — keeps the signal
